User can set up a list of items they want for their registry
people can log in and mark if they are buying the item or not. 
Allow for sorting of various options?
Once an Item has been marked as purchased it will be removed from the overall public list... 

Come up with a few different ideas as to who can see what:
user(host) can see their whole registry - who has bought what for them - Thank you Cards?
user(guest) can see which items they have opted into buying and the details of who they are sending it to
