Parent would input the various size parameters of their child (height, weight etc)
website will give back the appropriate size clothing they should be in. 

The response could be a response per clothing brand / clothing type / date etc 

Would need to work from a data source like a size guide from each clothing provider.

    Search size... reverse engineer the rest of the functionality essentially:
        (click a size and then generate the size guide parameters per brand...)
        (how big do i need to be to wear 3-6M? for example)
        (show list of brands: filter options: smallest, largest, A-Z, Z-A)



Work out a data structure to reference the baby size guides...
Work out how to print suggestions from a website... ( JS file 'print()'?). Would want to print to a pre-prepared PDF
